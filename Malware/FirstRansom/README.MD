EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY

This project is for learning how basic file encryption and decryption works.
It simulates ransomware behavior but should NEVER be used maliciously.

LEGALITY WARNING

Unauthorized use of ransomware or encryption malware is ILLEGAL and punishable by law.
Use these scripts ONLY in safe, controlled environments for educational or research purposes.
Do NOT run this on any computer or files you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

SCRIPTS

full.py   - This is the encryptor. It locks/encrypts your files and prints a secret key.
luff.py   - This is the decryptor. It unlocks/decrypts your files if you have the correct key.

HOW TO USE

1. Run full.py in the folder you want to encrypt.
2. Save the secret key it shows â€” this is needed to unlock files later.
3. Run luff.py in the same folder to decrypt files, when you have the key.

REMEMBER

- Losing the key means losing access to your files forever.
- These scripts are simple and made for learning, not for real attacks.
- Always test in a virtual machine or safe environment.

Use responsibly and carefully.
