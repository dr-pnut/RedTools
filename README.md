# Academic Cybersecurity Track

I am a high school student pursuing a structured, long-term path toward a career in offensive cybersecurity. This repository exists to document my academic development, technical skills progression, and preparation for post-secondary education in the field of cybersecurity and information security.

## Academic Objectives

My current academic focus is on building the foundational knowledge and skills necessary for success in a collegiate cybersecurity program. This includes coursework and self-study in the following areas:

- Computer networking
- Linux systems and administration
- Programming in Python, Bash, and C
- Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Cybersecurity fundamentals and red team operations

I am actively preparing for industry-recognized certifications that will support college admissions and future employment. These include CompTIA ITF+, Network+, and eJPT.

## College Preparation and Career Goals

My goal is to enter college with a demonstrated commitment to cybersecurity, backed by practical experience, academic rigor, and professional discipline. By the time I graduate college, I intend to be qualified for entry-level roles in red teaming, penetration testing, or offensive security engineering.

This repository is maintained as a record of academic growth and as part of my college preparation portfolio.
